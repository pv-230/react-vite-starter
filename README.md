# react-vite-starter

Quickly start React projects with Vite by using this template repo. ESLint has been configured with
some of my preferred rules and the project file structure has been set up according to my
preference. Intended to be used with the VSCode extensions `ESLint`, `Prettier - Code formatter`,
and `vscode-styled-components`.
